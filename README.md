# Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services
 
 ### Project Overview

In this project, we will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. we'll use **unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation**, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, we'll apply what we've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and **use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company**. The data that we will use has been provided by our partners at **Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics**, and represents a real-life data science task.
